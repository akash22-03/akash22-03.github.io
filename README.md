working on it.......

I have worked on this as a project of mine to test my hands on the frontend developement work.
I have used basic HTML and CSS with a touch of Javascript to make this webpage interactive and responsive.
For me, i learnt a lot of new things designing this webpage like creating buttons with such animations,
creating a pageloader and also the dark-day mode switcher with a bit help from Google as well.
I have created separate html and css file for the hamburger button and the normal button in single html file,
(button.html) you can check if you want to learn creating such buttons.
You can checkout the style-switcher.js and style-switcher.css, to know how i created the day-night mode,
also the preloader.js and preloader.css to checkout the preloader i created for my portfolio.
This webpage is also responsive, (you can checkout responsive.css) so the screen resolution won't affect much my content.
I will still work on it, in coming months i will be adding some more animations to make my homepage look a bit more attractive,
also i will add some more sections to showcase the projects i have worked on.
Hope you liked my Portfolio, and do follow my GitHub.
Thank You.!!
